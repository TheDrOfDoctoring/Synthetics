# Synthetics

## A Curseforge ModJam 2025 mod focused around adding player augmentation through cybernetic and biological means.  

## Description
This mod allows the player to research and install new augments and body parts to themselves, giving them new abilities and passive benefits.

Additionally, this mod places emphasis on being as data driven as possible, with the ability to add entirely new cybernetic augments, body parts and abilities


## Research

New augments and parts first have to be researched. This is done using the Research Table, right-clicking on which will open the research screen.
Each research has a set of parts it unlocks, and also has a set of requirements that can be viewed by right-clicking. 
If the requirements are met, and any parents are already researched, left-clicking will research it, consuming any items needed and using the required experience
