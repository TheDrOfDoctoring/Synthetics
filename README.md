# Synthetics

## A Curseforge ModJam 2025 mod focused around adding player augmentation through cybernetic and biological means.  

## Description
This mod allows the player to research and install new augments and body parts to themselves, giving them new abilities and passive benefits.

Additionally, this mod places emphasis on being as data driven as possible, with the ability to add entirely new cybernetic augments, body parts and abilities


## Research

New augments and parts first have to be researched. This is done using the Research Table, right-clicking on which will open the research screen.
Each research has a set of parts it unlocks, and also has a set of requirements that can be viewed by right-clicking. 
If the requirements are met, and any parents are already researched, left-clicking will research it, consuming any items needed and using the required experience

## Augmentation Chamber

The augmentation chamber is where you can install or remove parts. 
To install something, put an installabie item, such as an augment or body part, in the slot above the "Install" button.
Then, click the "Install" button. Any replaced or removed parts will be dropped into the output slots.

The menu on the right shows the installed body parts. Hovering over a body part will show what augments are attached to that body part.
To remove an augment, use scroll wheel to select it, then right click to remove it. It will be placed into the output slots.

On the left, hovering over a part you want to install will show a menu. Initially, it will show information about complexity, a body part or segment cannot have more complexity added to it than it's max.
Right-clicking will swap to the ability menu. This shows a list of abilities offered by the installable, and the stats of them. You can use the scroll wheel to navigate between abilities.
